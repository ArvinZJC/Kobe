# [Kobe](../../../..)/StockList

[简体中文](./README-zhCN.md) | **English**

TODO: This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file with Python code to retrieve and store a list of symbols and corresponding names of SH/SZ stocks in a JSON file which is a part of the resources of the app. The JSON file is processed to provide the autocomplete functionality of the text box control for inputing the symbol of an SH/SZ stock.

## ATTENTION

1. The IPYNB file can be opened and edited in Visual Studio Code (if supported). By 16 December 2021, everything looks good with the code editor (Version: 1.63.2). In addition, I would like to thank [TuShare Pro](https://tushare.pro/) for its valuabale data. The primary packages used in the development are listed in the following table.

   |     Name      | Version |
   | :-----------: | :-----: |
   |    python     | 3.10.1  |
   |    pandas     |  1.3.4  |
   | python-dotenv | 0.19.2  |
   |    tushare    | 1.2.77  |
